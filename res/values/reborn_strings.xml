    <string name="xosp_about1">XOSP which stands for the Xperia Open Source Project was a project originally created by me for the Galaxy S+ and it was created like 2 years ago when that time XOSP did not even existed and it was just S+ Reborn.</string> 
    <string name="xosp_about2">The main idea was to create a custom minimal Xperia based ROM, by including the essential things which a user would ever use from a ROM.The S+ Reborn became to be a big success because it was eventually ported on different Xperia Phones and some other Samsung devices and from there the XOSP project was founded.</string> 
    <string name="xosp_about3">From the XOSP prject also the Reborn addons were created featuring with an Aroma Installer. I worked on the project for 2 years by trying always to improve it constantly.</string>
    <string name="xosp_about4">Eventually for the fact that LP on my Galaxy S+ became to be quite buggy i decided to stop the development and for about half of year the project was left in stanby.</string> 
    <string name="xosp_about5">Untill i decided to bring it back again on the Zenfone 2 devices. The ROM will now also feature a White Indigo theme for all the ROM and of course the newest Xperia Applications ported from the SystemDumps provided by the Sony community and as tradition the ROM name (S+ Reborn) will remain the same. </string>
